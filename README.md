# EPP_Project_Laurenz_Guenther

The algorithm is meant to scrape all articles published by the Bildzeitung from its official archive. 
The number of these articles is very large and accordingly, it might take several days to scrape all articles. 
Accordingly in this version only a small, randomly chosen subsample of articles is scraped.
The ize of this subsample can be adjusted freely in the code. 
to do so, please read the code description.
